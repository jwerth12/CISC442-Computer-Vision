CISC442 PR3: Stereo Analysis

MAIN: 
To run the program, run the main.py file.
Each time you run the file, the program will prompt you for parameters and 
produce disparity maps for all 5 pairs using those parameters. 

OUTPUTS:
    - VALID MAPS: The valid maps (ones that have run through the validity checks / average neighborhood) can be found in the valid-maps folder
    - IMAGES: Images used for processing can be found in the images folder
    - ORIGINAL MAPS: the disparity maps that were initially created (through part 1)
    and have NOT been passed through validity checks can be found in the disparity-maps folder

RESULTS: 
The images were created using the following parameters: 
    - SEARCH RANGE: 80
    - template_x_size: 9
    - template_y_size: 9

For each stereo pair (5 total), 3 results were produced: one for each of the following distance measures
    - SSD
    - SAD
    - NCC 

The best reuslts from this implementation were found using SSD (sum of squared differences)
